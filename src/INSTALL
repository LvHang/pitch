These instructions are valid for UNIX-like systems (these steps have
been run on various Linux distributions; Darwin; Cygwin).

As the tool does not depend on any other toolkits, you just need to complete
the installation steps in src/INSTALL.

The installation instructions are

  ./configure --shared
  make depend
  make

Note that "make" takes a long time. You can speed it up by running make
in parallel if you have multiple CPUs, e.g. to use 8 CPUs

  make depend -j 8
  make -j 8

The standalone extractor requires a relatively recent C++ compiler with C++11 support,
e.g. g++ >= 4.7, Apple clang >= 5.0 or LLVM clang >= 3.3. If your system
default compiler does not support C++11, you can specify a C++11 compliant
compiler by setting the CXX environment variable, e.g.

  CXX=g++-4.8 ./configure --shared

The standalone extractor is based on Kaldi toolkit.
