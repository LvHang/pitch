/** The function ComplexFft does an Fft on the vector argument v.
   v is a vector of even dimension, interpreted for both input
   and output as a vector of complex numbers i.e.
   \f[ v = ( re_0, im_0, re_1, im_1, ... )    \f]
   The dimension of v must be a power of 2.

   If "forward == true" this routine does the Discrete Fourier Transform
   (DFT), i.e.:
   \f[   vout[m] \leftarrow \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} vin[i] exp( -2pi m n / N )  \f]

   If "backward" it does the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)
   *WITHOUT THE FACTOR 1/N*,
   i.e.:
   \f[   vout[m] <-- \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} vin[i] exp(  2pi m n / N )   \f]
   [note the sign difference on the 2 pi for the backward one.]

   Note that this is the definition of the FT given in most texts, but
   it differs from the Numerical Recipes version in which the forward
   and backward algorithms are flipped.

   Note that you would have to multiply by 1/N after the IDFT to get
   back to where you started from.  We don't do this because
   in some contexts, the transform is made symmetric by multiplying
   by sqrt(N) in both passes.   The user can do this by themselves.

   See also SplitRadixComplexFft, declared in srfft.h, which is more efficient
   but only works if the length of the input is a power of 2.
